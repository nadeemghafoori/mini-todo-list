# Mini Todo List

A simple Todo List app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### Features

- Add new todos
- Mark todos as completed (cross out)
- Delete todos

**Note:** This app stores todos only in the browser memory, so all data is lost on page refresh.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nadeemghafoori/mini-todo-list.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd mini-todo-list
   ```
3. Open `index.html` in your browser to view it.
